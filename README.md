# data-requests
Looking for a dataset from a government partner such as the City of San Jose or Valley Transportation Authority? 

Post your request on the [Issues](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/data-requests/issues) page. Be as specific as possible about desired attributes of the dataset, such as:
* Key data fields
* Time period (real-time, current, historical?) 
* Frequency (hourly, daily, monthly, annually?)
* Desired data format (shapefile, CSV, etc)
* If you have a specific purpose in mind for the data that you're willing to share (optional)

Code for San Jose's municipal liaison @mthong will route your inquiry to the appropriate contacts and respond with updates. 

This repo will provide a record of outstanding, in-progress and resolved data requests.
